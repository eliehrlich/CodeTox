## Basic linear algebra
A=rand(1:4,3,3)
x=fill(1.0,(3,)) # defines a vector of ones

# multiplication
b=A*x

# Tranposition
A'
transpose(A) # the same as A'

# Transposed multiplication
A'A # the same as A'*A

# Solving linear systems
A\b # \ --> solves the linear system Ax=b
Atall=rand(3,2)
Atall\b # for overdetermined systems --> it calculates the least square solution

# Concatenate two vectors
v=rand(3)
rankdef=hcat(v,v) # hcat for concatenating

# for rank-defficient least square problems
rankdef\b # it gives the minimum norm least square solution

# for underdetermined systems
bshort=rand(2)
Ashort=rand(2,3)
Ashort\bshort # it gives the minimum norm solution
